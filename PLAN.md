* Day 1: getting and parsing descriptions, describing the hanoi subgame; methods/events/exceptions, implementing the hanoi subgame
* Day 2: making or using an easy test framework (which I actually stick with), getting and parsing commands, looking around, moving around I (compass directions), moving around II (up/down, in/out), moving around III (movement synonyms), verb synonyms
* Day 3: room descriptions (look), saving and restoring, blocked exits, being blocked by the fire (fire, walls)
* Day 4: things and descriptions, things which can be opened, things which contain other things, platform things, things which you can read
* Day 5: hidden things which can be revealed, things which can be carried around, things which are part of the scenery
* Day 6: getting things from the car (car, rope, flashlight), finding the door in the grass (grass, bushes, door), filling your car with leaves (trees, leaves), putting the leaves in the basket (sign, basket, walls) (generally, getting, finding, and putting in/filling, which are really different levels of the same thing)
* Day 7: it's too dark in here! (can't see, turn on the flashlight), playing the hanoi game (walls, all the disks), being blocked by the fire (fire, walls), fetching water (brook, water, helmet), putting out the fire
* Day 8: doom and cavern collapse, triggering doom and dying (pedestal, butterfly, walls), tying up various loose ends, the finished game

------------------

* Is this schedule possible? Yes.
* Is it crazily optimistic? Yes.
* Is it subject to change? Yes.
* Is it going to be changed? Yes, almost certainly.
* Is it something I can brag about if I follow? Yes, and that's enough to try.

What will Day 1 be? Likely the 23rd or 24th, if not earlier. That means if I follow this schedule, the game will more or less overlap with Hanukkah, and not with January. That's nice.
