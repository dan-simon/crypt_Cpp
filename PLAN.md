* Day 1: getting and parsing descriptions, describing the hanoi subgame; methods/events/exceptions, implementing the hanoi subgame; adding license
* Day 2: making or using an easy test framework (which I actually stick with), getting and parsing commands, looking around, moving around I (compass directions), moving around II (up/down, in/out), moving around III (movement synonyms), verb synonyms
* Day 3: room descriptions (look), saving and restoring, blocked exits, being blocked by the fire (fire, walls)
* Day 4: things and descriptions, things which can be opened, things which contain other things, platform things, things which you can read
* Day 5: hidden things which can be revealed, things which can be carried around, things which are part of the scenery
* Day 6: getting things from the car (car, rope, flashlight), finding the door in the grass (grass, bushes, door), filling your car with leaves (trees, leaves), putting the leaves in the basket (sign, basket, walls) (generally, getting, finding, and putting in/filling, which are really different levels of the same thing)
* Day 7: it's too dark in here! (can't see, turn on the flashlight), playing the hanoi game (walls, all the disks), being blocked by the fire (fire, walls), fetching water (brook, water, helmet), putting out the fire
* Day 8: doom and cavern collapse, triggering doom and dying (pedestal, butterfly, walls); the seven tokens (my sole change); tying up various loose ends, the finished game
* Day 9: port days 1-4 back to Perl6
* Day 10: port days 5-8 back to Perl6

------------------

* Is this schedule possible? Yes.
* Is it crazily optimistic? Yes.
* Is it subject to change? Yes.
* Is it going to be changed? Yes, almost certainly.
* Is it something I can brag about if I follow? Yes, and that's enough to try.

What will Day 1 be? Maybe the 23rd of December 2018. I have looked at C++ and it is harder than either dynamic or functional languages. Maybe even than C; in C I would know that I had to start from scratch.

Alternatively, maybe I'll just do the Perl 6 part, but that feels fairly useless.
