Changes compared to the original:

* Bugs that I introduced accidentally and don't know about.

* The Seven Tokens, hidden throughout the game. If you get all seven, you "win" (the game says you have mastered reality, and you get special powers that make it easy to win, but you don't actually win automatically).
