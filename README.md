This repository exists to help me learn C++ by porting Crypt to it. Because what better way is there to learn C++ than porting a program in another language I don't know much of to it? Come to think of it, there are probably a bunch of ways, but somehow this one seems fun.

This was delayed by almost exactly a year, but is likely happening. I added a .cpp hello world file to show that at least something is happening.

Note that the original Perl6 version of Crypt breaks due to changes to the language, so this will perhaps be the only working version. Thus, an additional goal will be to port back to Perl6.

This version will be officially called "Cavern", so that it satisfies the original version's license requirement "the Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of the Standard Version."
